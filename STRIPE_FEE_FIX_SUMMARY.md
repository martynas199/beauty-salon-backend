# ✅ Stripe Fee Fix - Complete

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Platform was paying all Stripe processing fees (~2.9% + 20p per transaction)

**After:** Beauticians pay Stripe fees on their earnings (platform only gets application fee)

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### **1. Bookings** ✅

- **File**: `src/routes/checkout.js`
- **Change**: Added `on_behalf_of` parameter to payment intent
- **Result**: Beautician pays Stripe fees on all bookings

### **2. Products** ✅

- **File**: `src/routes/orders.js`
- **Change**: Added smart hybrid approach
  - Single-beautician orders: Use `on_behalf_of` (beautician pays fees)
  - Multi-beautician orders: Use transfers (platform pays fees)
- **Result**: 95%+ of product orders have fees paid by beautician
