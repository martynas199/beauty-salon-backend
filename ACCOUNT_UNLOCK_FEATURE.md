# Account Unlock Feature - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive account unlock system that allows super administrators to unlock user accounts that have been locked due to failed login attempts.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Models

#### Admin Model (`src/models/Admin.js`)

- **Existing fields utilized**:
  - `loginAttempts`: Number - tracks failed login attempts
  - `lockUntil`: Date - timestamp when lock expires
- **Enhanced toJSON() method**:
  - Returns `isLocked` computed field for frontend
  - Includes `lockInfo` object when account is locked
  - Shows loginAttempts and lockUntil for locked accounts

#### AuditLog Model (`src/models/AuditLog.js`) - NEW

- Tracks all administrative actions including account unlocks
- Fields:
  - `action`: Type of action performed
  - `performedBy`: Admin who performed action
  - `targetUser`: User affected by action
  - `details`: Additional context
  - `ipAddress` & `userAgent`: Request metadata
- Indexed for efficient queries

### 2. API Endpoints

#### POST `/admin/admins/:adminId/unlock`

- **Authorization**: Super admin only
- **Functionality**:
  - Validates super admin permission
  - Checks if account is actually locked
  - Resets `loginAttempts` to 0
  - Clears `lockUntil` field
  - Creates audit log entry
  - Sends email notification to unlocked user
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Account unlocked successfully",
    "admin": {
      "_id": "...",
      "name": "...",
      "email": "...",
      "isLocked": false
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Enhanced Login Logic (`src/routes/auth.js`)

#### Auto-Unlock Feature

- Before checking if account is locked, system checks if `lockUntil` has expired
- If expired, automatically unlocks the account:
  ```javascript
  if (admin.lockUntil && admin.lockUntil < Date.now()) {
    admin.loginAttempts = 0;
    admin.lockUntil = undefined;
    await admin.save();
  }
  ```

#### Improved Error Messages

- Shows time remaining when account is locked:
  ```
  "Account is temporarily locked due to too many failed login attempts.
   Please try again in X minute(s)."
  ```
- Includes `minutesRemaining` in response

### 4. Email Notifications

#### Unlock Notification Email

- Sent automatically when account is unlocked by admin
- Uses existing nodemailer transport from `mailer.js`
- Professional HTML design with:
  - Clear unlock confirmation
  - Security warning
  - Noble Elegance branding
- Plain text fallback included

### 5. Audit Logging

- Every unlock action is logged with:
  - Admin who performed unlock
  - Target user unlocked
  - Timestamp
  - IP address
  - User agent
  - Details (admin name, email)

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Admin Management UI (`src/admin/pages/AdminBeauticianLink.jsx`)

#### Visual Indicators

- Locked accounts show 🔒 badge next to role
- Badge styling: `bg-red-100 text-red-800`
- Visible in admin list table

#### Unlock Button

- Only visible to super admins
- Only shown when account is locked
- Styled with green theme: `border-green-300 text-green-700 hover:bg-green-50`
- Icon: 🔓 Unlock

#### Confirmation Modal

- Toast-based confirmation dialog
- Clear warning about action
- Two-button interface:
  - "Yes, Unlock" (green) - confirms action
  - "Cancel" (gray) - dismisses modal

### 2. API Integration

#### `handleUnlock(admin)` Function

- Validates super admin permission
- Checks if account is locked
- Shows confirmation dialog
- Calls API endpoint on confirmation

#### `performUnlock(adminId)` Function

- Makes POST request to `/admin/admins/:adminId/unlock`
- Handles success:
  - Shows success toast with 🔓 icon
  - Reloads admin list to update UI
- Handles errors:
  - Displays specific error messages
  - Logs errors for debugging

### 3. User Experience Features

- Success message: "Account unlocked successfully! User can now log in."
- Error handling with specific messages from backend
- Automatic list refresh after unlock
- Loading states managed properly

## Security Features

### 1. Authorization

- ✅ Only super admins can unlock accounts
- ✅ JWT token validation required
- ✅ Role check on every request

### 2. Validation

- ✅ Verifies user ID exists
- ✅ Checks if account is actually locked
- ✅ Prevents errors from invalid operations

### 3. Audit Trail

- ✅ Every unlock logged with full context
- ✅ IP address and user agent tracked
- ✅ Searchable by admin, target user, or action type

### 4. Rate Limiting

- Backend uses existing rate limiting middleware
- Recommended: Add specific rate limit for unlock endpoint

## Lock Configuration

### Current Settings

- **Max Login Attempts**: 5 failed attempts
- **Lock Duration**: 2 hours (7200000 ms)
- **Auto-Unlock**: Yes - happens on next login attempt after expiration

### Lock Logic (in Admin model)

```javascript
const maxAttempts = 5;
const lockTime = 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 2 hours

if (this.loginAttempts + 1 >= maxAttempts && !this.isLocked()) {
  updates.$set = { lockUntil: Date.now() + lockTime };
}
```

## Optional Enhancements (Future)

### 1. Configurable Settings

Create admin settings page to customize:

- Maximum login attempts (currently 5)
- Lock duration (currently 2 hours)
- Enable/disable auto-unlock
- Email notifications on/off

### 2. Dashboard Widget

- Show count of currently locked accounts
- Quick unlock button on dashboard
- Alert when multiple accounts are locked

### 3. Enhanced Notifications

- Email to super admins when account gets locked
- SMS notifications for critical accounts
- Slack/Teams integration for team alerts

### 4. Unlock History

- Dedicated page showing unlock audit log
- Filter by date range, admin, or target user
- Export to CSV for compliance
