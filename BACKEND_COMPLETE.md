# Stripe Connect Implementation Complete! 🎉

## ✅ Backend Implementation Status: 100%

All backend functionality for Stripe Connect has been successfully implemented and tested.

### What's Been Completed:

#### 1. Database Models ✅

- **Beautician**: Added Stripe Connect fields (account ID, status, earnings tracking)
- **Appointment**: Extended payment tracking with platform fees and Connect data
- **Product**: Added beautician ownership field
- **Order**: Added multi-beautician payment tracking and refund status

#### 2. API Endpoints ✅

**Stripe Connect Management** (`/api/connect/`)

- `POST /onboard` - Create Express account & generate onboarding link
- `GET /status/:beauticianId` - Check account verification status
- `POST /dashboard-link/:beauticianId` - Generate Stripe Express dashboard access
- `DELETE /disconnect/:beauticianId` - Disconnect account (admin/testing)

**Revenue Reporting** (`/api/reports/`)

- `GET /revenue` - Platform-wide revenue with date filtering
- `GET /beautician-earnings/:beauticianId` - Individual earnings breakdown

**Product Checkout** (`/api/orders/`)

- `POST /checkout` - Create Stripe checkout session with Connect transfers
- `GET /confirm-checkout` - Process transfers to beauticians after payment
- `POST /:id/refund` - Full refund with reversed transfers

#### 3. Payment Flows ✅

**Booking Payments** (`/api/checkout/`)

- Automatically deducts £0.50 platform fee
- Transfers remaining amount to beautician's Stripe account
- Tracks earnings and updates beautician totals
- Falls back to regular payment if beautician not connected

**Product Payments** (`/api/orders/checkout`)

- Groups products by beautician ownership
- Creates transfers after payment completion
- 100% goes to product owner (no platform fee)
- Supports multi-beautician orders

#### 4. Refund Logic ✅

**Booking Refunds** (`/payments/stripe.js`)

- Enhanced `refundPayment()` function with Connect parameters
- `refund_application_fee: true` - Returns £0.50 to platform
- `reverse_transfer: true` - Takes money back from beautician
- Automatic earnings deduction

**Product Refunds** (`/api/orders/:id/refund`)

- Reverses all transfers to beauticians
- Restores product stock
- Deducts from beautician earnings
- Updates order and payment status

#### 5. Webhook Handlers ✅

Enhanced `/api/webhooks/stripe` with Connect events:

- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Confirm booking/order
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Mark failures
- `charge.refunded` - Handle refunds
- `account.updated` - Sync beautician Stripe status
- `payout.paid` - Track beautician payouts

#### 6. Documentation ✅

- `STRIPE_CONNECT_GUIDE.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Progress tracking
- `.env.example` - Updated with all required variables
- Inline code comments and console logging

### Server Status: ✅ Running

Backend server successfully started with all routes registered:

- No syntax errors
- All Stripe instances properly initialized
- Fallback to `STRIPE_SECRET` if `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` not set

## 🚧 Remaining Tasks: Frontend Only

### Priority 1: Beautician UI

**File**: `src/admin/pages/Settings.jsx` or new `BeauticianSettings.jsx`

Need to add:

- [ ] "Connect with Stripe" button
- [ ] Display connection status (badge with color)
- [ ] "View Earnings" button → opens earnings modal/page
- [ ] "Access Stripe Dashboard" button
- [ ] Handle onboarding redirect callbacks

Example component structure:

```jsx
function StripeConnectSection({ beauticianId }) {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch connection status
    fetch(`/api/connect/status/${beauticianId}`)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then(setStatus);
  }, [beauticianId]);

  const handleConnect = async () => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/connect/onboard", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        beauticianId,
        email: user.email,
      }),
    });
    const { url } = await res.json();
    window.location.href = url; // Redirect to Stripe onboarding
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {status?.connected ? (
        <>
          <Badge color="green">Connected</Badge>
          <Button onClick={viewEarnings}>View Earnings</Button>
          <Button onClick={accessDashboard}>Stripe Dashboard</Button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <Button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect with Stripe</Button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Priority 2: Beautician Earnings Dashboard

**File**: `src/admin/pages/Earnings.jsx` or modal in Settings

Display:

- [ ] Total earnings (all-time)
- [ ] Booking revenue vs product revenue
- [ ] Platform fees deducted
- [ ] Net earnings
- [ ] Recent transactions table
- [ ] Payout history
- [ ] Date range filter

API call: `GET /api/reports/beautician-earnings/:beauticianId`

### Priority 3: Admin Revenue Dashboard

**File**: `src/admin/pages/Revenue.jsx`

Display:

- [ ] Platform earnings (total £0.50 fees collected)
- [ ] Total platform revenue
- [ ] Revenue by beautician (table)
- [ ] Date range filter
- [ ] Export to CSV button
- [ ] Revenue charts (optional)

API call: `GET /api/reports/revenue?startDate=X&endDate=Y`
