# Product Payment Tests

## Test Scenarios for Direct Beautician Payments (Zero Platform Fees)

### 1. Single Product Checkout - Success
**Setup:**

- ✅ Platform account charged £0
- ✅ No application_fee_amount in payment_intent_data
- ✅ Order status: paid
- ✅ Beautician earnings increased by £50

**Test Command:**
```bash

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [{
      "productId": "PRODUCT_A_ID",
      "quantity": 1
    }],
    "shippingAddress": {
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "firstName": "Test",
      "lastName": "User",
      "address": "123 Test St",
      "city": "London",
      "postalCode": "SW1A 1AA",
      "country": "United Kingdom",
      "phone": "+44 20 1234 5678"
    },
    "shippingMethod": {
      "name": "Standard",
      "price": 5.99
    }
  }'
```

**Verify:**
1. Check Stripe Dashboard → Beautician 1 account
2. Confirm direct charge (not transfer)
3. Verify fee is deducted from Beautician 1's payout

### 2. Multiple Products, Same Beautician - Success
**Setup:**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Single checkout session created
- ✅ Single destination charge to Beautician 1
- ✅ Beautician 1 pays fees on £70 + shipping
- ✅ Platform pays £0
- ✅ Beautician earnings increased by £70

---

### 3. Multiple Products, Different Beauticians - Rejected
**Setup:**
- Product A belongs to Beautician 1
- Product B belongs to Beautician 2
- Both beauticians connected

**Expected:**
- ❌ 400 Error: "Cannot checkout with products from multiple beauticians. Please complete separate orders for each beautician."
- ✅ No payment session created
- ✅ User prompted to checkout separately

**Test Command:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/orders/checkout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      {"productId": "PRODUCT_A_ID", "quantity": 1},
      {"productId": "PRODUCT_B_ID", "quantity": 1}
    ],
    "shippingAddress": {...}
  }'
```

---

### 4. Beautician Not Connected to Stripe - Rejected
**Setup:**
- Product A belongs to Beautician 1

**Expected:**
- ❌ 400 Error: "Product [name] belongs to a beautician who hasn't set up payment processing yet. Please contact support."
- ✅ No payment session created
- ✅ User sees clear error message

---

### 5. Price Manipulation Attempt - Blocked
**Setup:**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Server uses database price (£50), ignores client price
- ✅ Checkout session created with correct £50 price
- ✅ Security validation passes

**Test Command:**
```bash
# Send manipulated price (should be ignored)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/orders/checkout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [{
      "productId": "PRODUCT_A_ID",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 10
    }],
    "shippingAddress": {...}
  }'
```

**Verify:**
- Check Stripe session line items - should show £50, not £10

---

### 6. Invalid Quantity - Rejected
**Setup:**
- Product A: £50
- Request with quantity: -1 or 0 or 1.5

**Expected:**
- ❌ 400 Error: "Invalid quantity for [product name]"
- ✅ No session created

---

### 7. Order Confirmation Flow
**Setup:**
- Completed checkout session from Test #1
- Stripe payment successful

**Expected:**
- ✅ Order status updated to "paid"
- ✅ stripeConnectPayments[0].status = "succeeded"
- ✅ Beautician totalEarnings incremented correctly
- ✅ Stock reduced for products
- ✅ Customer email sent
- ✅ Admin notification sent

---

### 8. Product Refund - Full Reversal

- ✅ Money returned from Beautician 1 to customer
- ✅ Stripe fees NOT refunded to beautician

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reason": "Customer request"
  }'
```

---

### 9. Service vs Product Checkout Comparison
**IMPORTANT:** Verify services still work correctly

**Service Booking (should be UNCHANGED):**
- ✅ Uses application_fee_amount: 50 (50p platform fee)
- ✅ Uses transfer_data.destination
- ✅ Beautician receives: payment - Stripe fees - 50p platform fee
- ✅ Platform receives: 50p per booking

**Product Checkout (NEW behavior):**
- ✅ NO application_fee_amount
- ✅ Uses transfer_data.destination
- ✅ Beautician receives: payment - Stripe fees
- ✅ Platform receives: £0

---

### 10. Mixed Cart (Service + Product) - If Supported
**Note:** Check if system supports this or if separate checkouts required

If supported:
- Service: Use application_fee_amount
- Product: Use destination charge without fee

If not supported:
- Reject with clear error message

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Create 2 test beauticians
   - Connect Beautician 1 to Stripe (use Stripe test mode)
   - Leave Beautician 2 unconnected
   - Create 3 test products:
     - Product A (Beautician 1) - £30
     - Product B (Beautician 1) - £40
     - Product C (Beautician 2) - £50

2. **Run Test Suite:**
   ```bash
   # Test 1: Single product
   # Test 2: Multiple products, same beautician
   # Test 3: Multiple products, different beauticians (should fail)
   # Test 4: Product from unconnected beautician (should fail)
   # Test 5: Complete checkout and verify Stripe Dashboard
   # Test 6: Issue refund and verify reversal
   ```

3. **Verify in Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Check Beautician 1's Stripe account
   - Confirm charges show as direct charges (not transfers)
   - Verify fees are shown on beautician's side
   - Confirm platform account has £0 from product sales

4. **Compare Service Bookings:**
   - Make a test service booking
   - Verify 50p platform fee is still collected
   - Confirm product orders have no platform fee

---

## Expected Outcomes Summary

| Scenario | Platform Fee | Stripe Fees Paid By | Payment Method |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Service Booking | 50p | Beautician | Destination + App Fee |
| Single Product | £0 | Beautician | Destination Charge |
| Multi-Product (Same) | £0 | Beautician | Destination Charge |
| Multi-Product (Different) | N/A | N/A | ❌ Rejected |

---

## Notes for Developers

- Products MUST have a beauticianId assigned
- Beauticians MUST complete Stripe Connect onboarding before products can be sold
- Frontend should prevent multi-beautician cart checkout (UI validation)
- Backend enforces single-beautician rule (API validation)
- No changes needed to service booking flow
