# ✅ FIXED: Beautician Now Pays Stripe Fees (Direct Charges)

## 🔧 What We Changed

### **Problem**

Even with `on_behalf_of` parameter set, the platform was still paying Stripe processing fees (~£1.83 per £50 booking).

### **Root Cause**

We were using **Destination Charges** which always make the platform pay Stripe fees, regardless of `on_behalf_of` parameter.

### **Solution**

Switched to **Direct Charges** - creating the checkout session directly on the beautician's Stripe account.

---

## 📝 Code Changes

### **File: `src/routes/checkout.js`**

**Before (Destination Charges):**

```javascript
// Platform creates session, transfers to beautician
const stripe = getStripe(); // Platform account
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  payment_intent_data: {
    application_fee_amount: 50,
    on_behalf_of: beautician.stripeAccountId, // This didn't work!
    transfer_data: {
      destination: beautician.stripeAccountId,
    },
  },
  // ... other config
});
```

**After (Direct Charges):**

```javascript
// Beautician creates session directly on their account
const stripe = getStripe(beautician.stripeAccountId); // Connected account!
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  payment_intent_data: {
    application_fee_amount: 50, // Platform gets £0.50
    // No transfer_data needed - charge is directly on beautician account
  },
  // ... other config
});
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Destination Charges** (Old - Didn't Work):

- Platform account creates PaymentIntent
- Funds collected on platform account
- Platform pays Stripe fees (~£1.83)
- Platform transfers net amount to beautician
- Platform takes application fee (£0.50)
- **Result**: Platform loses ~£1.33 per booking

### **Direct Charges** (New - Works):

- Beautician account creates PaymentIntent
- Funds collected directly on beautician account
- **Beautician pays Stripe fees** (~£1.83)
- Platform automatically receives application fee (£0.50)
- **Result**: Platform gains £0.50 per booking, beautician pays their own fees

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Only works for connected beauticians**: If beautician isn't connected to Stripe, booking falls back to platform account (platform pays fees)

2. **Application fee goes to platform automatically**: No manual transfer needed - Stripe handles it

3. **Beautician sees full £50 charge**: Stripe fees are deducted from their Stripe balance, not shown in individual payment

4. **Platform only sees £0.50**: Your dashboard will only show the application fee amount
