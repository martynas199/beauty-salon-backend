# Stripe Connect Implementation - Progress Summary

## ✅ Completed (Backend Foundation)

### 1. Database Models Updated

- **Beautician Model** (`src/models/Beautician.js`)
  - Added `stripeAccountId`, `stripeStatus`, `stripeOnboardingCompleted`
  - Added `totalEarnings`, `totalPayouts`, `lastPayoutDate` tracking
- **Appointment Model** (`src/models/Appointment.js`)
  - Extended `payment.stripe` with `platformFee`, `beauticianStripeAccount`, `transferId`
- **Product Model** (`src/models/Product.js`)
  - Added `beauticianId` to track product ownership
- **Order Model** (`src/models/Order.js`)
  - Added `stripeConnectPayments` array for multi-beautician orders
  - Added `refundStatus`, `refundedAt`, `refundReason` fields
  - Added `beauticianId` to order items

### 2. Stripe Connect API Routes Created

**File:** `src/routes/connect.js`

- `POST /api/connect/onboard` - Create Express account & onboarding link
- `GET /api/connect/status/:beauticianId` - Check account verification status
- `POST /api/connect/dashboard-link/:beauticianId` - Generate dashboard login
- `DELETE /api/connect/disconnect/:beauticianId` - Disconnect account (admin/testing)

### 3. Enhanced Webhook Handlers

**File:** `src/routes/webhooks.js`

Added handlers for:

- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Confirm booking/order payment
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Mark payment failures
- `charge.refunded` - Handle refunds for bookings & products
- `account.updated` - Sync beautician Stripe status
- `payout.paid` - Track beautician payouts

### 4. Revenue Reporting System

**File:** `src/routes/reports.js`

- `GET /api/reports/revenue` - Platform-wide revenue with filters
  - Aggregate bookings & product sales by beautician
  - Calculate platform fees vs beautician earnings
  - Support date range filtering
- `GET /api/reports/beautician-earnings/:beauticianId` - Individual earnings
  - Detailed booking history with platform fees
  - Product sales breakdown
  - Recent transactions
  - Stripe payout tracking

### 5. Documentation

- **STRIPE_CONNECT_GUIDE.md** - Complete implementation guide

  - Setup instructions
  - API documentation
  - Payment flow examples
  - Testing scenarios
  - Troubleshooting

- **.env.example** - Updated with Stripe Connect variables

### 6. Server Configuration

- Registered all new routes in `src/server.js`
- Connect routes protected (require authentication)
- Webhooks use raw body for signature verification

## 🚧 Remaining Tasks

### Frontend Integration (Priority)

1. **Beautician Connect UI** - Admin panel

   - "Connect with Stripe" button
   - Onboarding redirect handling
   - Status indicator (connected/pending/rejected)
   - Dashboard link button

2. **Beautician Earnings View**

   - Total earnings display
   - Booking vs product revenue breakdown
   - Recent transactions list
   - Payout history
   - Stripe dashboard access button

3. **Admin Revenue Dashboard**
   - Platform earnings summary
   - Revenue by beautician table
   - Date range filter
   - Export to CSV functionality
   - Revenue charts/graphs

### Backend Payment Integration (Critical)

4. **Update Booking Checkout**

   - Modify `src/routes/checkout.js` to create PaymentIntent with:
     - `application_fee_amount: 50` (£0.50)
     - `transfer_data.destination: beauticianStripeAccount`
   - Store platform fee in appointment

5. **Update Product Checkout**

   - Modify product checkout to group items by beautician
   - Create separate PaymentIntents for each beautician
   - Store Connect payment details in Order

6. **Implement Refund Logic**
   - Create refund endpoint for bookings
   - Create refund endpoint for products
   - Use `refund_application_fee: true` and `reverse_transfer: true`

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for MVP)

1. Update checkout flows to use Stripe Connect
2. Test booking payment with connected account
3. Test product checkout with connected account
4. Implement refund functionality
5. Add basic frontend UI for onboarding

### Short Term (User Experience)

1. Build beautician earnings dashboard
2. Build admin revenue dashboard
3. Add email notifications for payouts
4. Create CSV export functionality

### Long Term (Advanced Features)

1. Handle multi-beautician product orders (split payments)
2. Dynamic platform fee configuration
3. Commission-based product sales
4. Dispute management UI
5. Advanced analytics and reporting

## 🔧 Environment Setup Required

Before testing, add to `.env`:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...  # Your Stripe secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  # Webhook signing secret
STRIPE_PLATFORM_FEE=50  # £0.50 in pence
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Configure webhook in Stripe Dashboard:

- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
- Events: `payment_intent.*`, `charge.refunded`, `account.updated`, `payout.paid`

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Express Accounts** - Chosen for simplicity, Stripe handles KYC/compliance
2. **£0.50 Flat Fee** - Simple, predictable cost for bookings
3. **No Product Fee** - Encourages beauticians to add products
4. **Separate Payment Intents** - Allows multi-beautician orders
5. **Webhook-Driven** - Reliable status updates via Stripe webhooks

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- All beauticians must complete Stripe onboarding before accepting payments
- Platform fee is charged per booking, not per product
- Refunds automatically reverse transfers and fees
- Payouts handled entirely by Stripe (2-day rolling basis)
- Admin has no control over payout timing
- Test mode required before production launch
