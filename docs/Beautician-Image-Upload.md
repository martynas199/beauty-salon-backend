## Database Schema

The `Beautician` model stores images in the following format:

```javascript
{
  image: {
    provider: "cloudinary",        // Always "cloudinary" for uploaded images
    id: "beauticians/abc123...",   // Cloudinary public_id (for deletion)
    url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/...", // Full image URL
    alt: "Beautician Name",        // Alt text (defaults to beautician name)
    width: 1200,                   // Image width in pixels
    height: 1200                   // Image height in pixels
  }
}
```

## Features

1. **Automatic Old Image Deletion**: When uploading a new image, the old image is automatically deleted from Cloudinary
2. **Temporary File Cleanup**: Temporary files are always cleaned up, even on error
3. **Cloudinary Organization**: Images are uploaded to the `beauticians` folder
4. **Metadata Storage**: Width, height, and public_id are stored for future use

## Frontend Integration

The frontend uses a two-step process:

1. **Save Beautician**: Create/update beautician without image
2. **Upload Image**: If a new image was selected, upload it separately

This ensures the beautician is saved even if image upload fails.

See `src/admin/pages/Staff.jsx` for implementation example.

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

**Important**: Do NOT use quotes around the values in `.env` files.

## Testing

To verify Cloudinary is configured correctly:

```bash
node scripts/check-env.js
node scripts/test-cloudinary.js
```
